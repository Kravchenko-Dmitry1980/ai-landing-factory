# AI Landing Factory

Content-first pipeline: materials → extraction → LandingContract → preview/export.

## Quick Start

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Kravchenko-Dmitry1980/ai-landing-factory.git
cd ai-landing-factory
.\run.ps1
```

Open the URL printed in the console (for example `http://localhost:3000`).

Then:

1. Upload PPTX / DOCX / TXT / PDF
2. Review the generated landing
3. Edit sections if something was missed
4. Export HTML

**Advanced OCR/VLM is optional and disabled by default.** You do not need Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, Ollama, or local models for the default path.

## Stop

```powershell
.\scripts\stop_dev.ps1
```

## Simple QA (no OCR/VLM)

```powershell
.\scripts\smoke_simple_product.ps1
.\scripts\uat_fresh_clone_check.ps1
.\scripts\check_all.ps1 -Simple
```
